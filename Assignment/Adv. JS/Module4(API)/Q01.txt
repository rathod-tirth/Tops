>> JSON

=> JSON stands for "JavaScript Object Notation," is a lightweight and widely used data interchange format. 
It's designed to be easy for humans to read and write, and also easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is 
often used to transmit data between a server and a web application, but it's also used for configuration files, APIs, 
and more.

=> JSON is structured as a collection of key-value pairs.

=> JSON supports various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, null, objects, and arrays.

{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "grades": [95, 88, 76],
  "isStudent": true,
  "address": null
}

JSON is relatively compact compared to other data formats, which makes it efficient for transmitting data over networks.
