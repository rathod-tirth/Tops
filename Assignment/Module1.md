# Module 1 (Overview of IT Industry)

### **1. What is software?**
    Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is 
    the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is a generic term used to 
    refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a 
    computer, while hardware is the invariable part.

### **2. Types of software.**
    The two main categories of software are application software and system software. An application is software that fulfills a specific need 
    or performs tasks. System software is designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of.

### **3. What is Software Development Methodology?**
    A software development methodology is a process by which developers design, implement and test new computer programs. Following a 
    methodology benefits developers because these processes lay out a structured sequence of steps that guide professionals through each stage 
    of development. Additionally, development methodologies often follow a design philosophy, which can help developers align their process and 
    the product's features with its functional goals. For example, the developer may define what the software product does and what problems it 
    solves for users as part of their design philosophy.

### **4. What is Design Pattern?**
    Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns are solutions to 
    general problems that software developers faced during software development. These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous 
    software developers over quite a substantial period of time.

## **Intermediate**

### **1. What is the difference between Application software and System software?**
    -> System Software :
    1. General-purpose software that manages basic system resources and processes
    2. Written in low-level assembly language or machine code
    3. Must meet specific hardware needs; interacts closely with hardware
    4. Installed at the same time as the OS, usually by the manufacturer
    5. Runs any time the computer is on
    6. Works in the background and users don't usually access it
    7. Is necessary for the system to function
---
    -> Application Software :
    1. Software that performs specific tasks to meest user needs
    2. Written in higher-level languages, such as Python and JavaScript
    3. Does not take hardware into account and doesn't interact directly with hardware
    4. User or admin installs software when needed
    5. User triggers and stops the program
    6. Runs in the foreground and users work directly with the software to performs specific tasks
    7. Needs system software to run
    8. Isn't needed for the system to funtion

### **2. Explain the SDLC. Each phase process.**
    Software Development is the development of software for distinct purposes. For software development, there is a specific programming 
    language like Java, Python, C/C++, etc. The entire process of software development isn’t as simple as its definition, it’s a complicated 
    process. Accordingly, it requires an efficient approach from the developer in the form of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 

    Proper planning and execution are the key components of a successful software development process. The entire software development process 
    includes 6 stages. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the common term to summarize these 6 stages. 

    SDLC specifies the task(s) to be performed at various stages by a software engineer/developer. It ensures that the end product is able to 
    meet the customer’s expectations and fits in the overall budget. Hence, it’s vital for a software developer to have prior knowledge of this 
    software development process.

-> These 6 stages are discussed below. 

**• Stage-1: Planning And Requirement Analysis:**

    Planning is the crucial step in everything and so as in software development. In this same stage, requirement 
    analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from the inputs from the 
    customers, sales department/market surveys. 
    The information from this analysis forms the building block of a basic project. The quality proof of the project 
    is a result of planning. Thus, in this stage, the basic project is designed with all the available information.

**• Stage-2: Defining Requirements:**

    In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from 
    the customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
    This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that 
    specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle.

**• Stage-3: Designing Architecture:** 

    SRS is a reference for software designers to come out with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with 
    the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design 
    Document Specification (DDS). 
    This DDS is assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating all the possible factors, the most 
    practical and logical design is chosen for the development.

**• Stage-4: Developing Product:**

    At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific 
    programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set 
    by the association. Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put 
    into use at this stage. Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the 
    software regulations.

**• Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration:**

    After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC. 
    Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product 
    confronts the quality requirements of SRS.

**• Stage 6: Deployment and Maintenance Of Product:**

    After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it 
    is tested in a real industrial environment. Because it is important to ensure its smooth performance. If it 
    performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the 
    company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers. However, this alone is not enough. Therefore, along with the deployment, the product’s supervision.
