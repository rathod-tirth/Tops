## Q-04) What is CLI command In React Js?

In React.js, there are several CLI (Command Line Interface) commands that you can use to create, develop, test, and build your React applications. 

These commands are provided by a tool called "Create React App," which is a popular way to set up and manage React projects. Create React App abstracts away a lot of the configuration and setup, allowing you to focus on building your application.

Examples :-
```
npx create-react-app my-app
npm start
npm run build
npm test
npm run eject
```
