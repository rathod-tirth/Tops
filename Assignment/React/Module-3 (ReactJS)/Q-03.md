## Q-03) What is Role of Node Js in react Js?

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Node.js enables React applications to implement server-side rendering, where the initial rendering of the React components occurs on the server before sending it to the client. This improves SEO, initial page load performance, and user experience.

2. **Build and Development Tools:** Node.js is used to run build tools like Webpack and Babel, which are essential for transpiling and bundling React code. It also supports package management through tools like npm, facilitating the installation of dependencies and managing project scripts.

3. **API Integration:** Node.js is often used on the server-side to create APIs that the React front-end can communicate with. It allows for efficient data retrieval and manipulation, enhancing the real-time interactivity of React applications.

4. **Middleware:** Node.js can act as a middleware layer, handling tasks like authentication, routing, and serving static assets, which complements React's role in the frontend, providing a complete end-to-end solution for web development.
