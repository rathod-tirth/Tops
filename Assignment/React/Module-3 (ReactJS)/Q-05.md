## Q-05) What is Components in React Js?

In React.js, "components" are the building blocks of a user interface (UI). They are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that encapsulate a specific part of a user interface. 

React applications are typically composed of multiple components that work together to create a complete UI. Components can represent everything from small, individual UI elements (e.g., buttons, input fields) to entire complex sections of a web page (e.g., header, sidebar, main content).

Here are some key characteristics and concepts related to React components:

1. **Reusability**: One of the primary benefits of using components is reusability. You can create a component once and use it multiple times throughout your application.

2. **Props**: Components can receive data from their parent components through props (short for "properties"). Props are read-only and allow you to pass information from one component to another.

3. **State**: Components can also have their own local state, which is used to manage data that can change over time and affect the component's rendering. State is mutable and can be updated using the `setState` method.

4. **Lifecycle Methods**: React components have a lifecycle with various methods that you can override to perform actions at different stages of a component's existence, such as when it's created, updated, or destroyed.

5. **Functional Components and Class Components**: React components can be defined as functional components (using functions) or class components (using ES6 classes). Functional components have become more prevalent with the introduction of React Hooks, which allow functional components to manage state and side effects.

Here's a simple example of a functional React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
}

export default MyComponent;
```
```jsx
<MyComponent name="Alice" />
<MyComponent name="Bob" />
```
