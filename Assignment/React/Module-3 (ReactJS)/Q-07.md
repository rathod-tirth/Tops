## Q-07) How to install React Js on Windows, linux Operating System? How to install NPM and How to check version of NPM?

To install React.js on both Windows and Linux operating systems, you'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) as React.js is built on top of them. Here are the steps to install React.js on both Windows and Linux:

### Install Node.js and npm:

1. **Windows:**
   - Go to the official Node.js website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
   - Download latest version for Windows.
   - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Linux:**
   - You can install Node.js and npm using your package manager. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, open a terminal and run:
     ```
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
     ```
     On Red Hat/Fedora-based systems, you can use `yum` or `dnf` instead of `apt-get`.

### Check Version:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

This will display the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

### Create a React.js Application:

Now create a new React.js application using the `create-react-app` tool, which simplifies the setup process.

#### **Windows & Linux:**

1. **New ReactJS application:**

   Open your terminal/command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-react-app
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   ```

### Start the React Development Server:

Now start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open your React application in a web browser.
