## Q-03) What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?

- A `PureComponent` is a class component provided by React that is similar to a regular `Component`, but with an optimization for performance. The key difference between the two lies in how they handle updates and re-rendering.

- When a React component extends `PureComponent`, it automatically performs a shallow comparison of its `props` and `state` whenever the `shouldComponentUpdate` lifecycle method is triggered.

- The `shouldComponentUpdate` method in a `PureComponent` compares the new `props` and `state` with the previous ones using a shallow equality check (`===`). 

- If there's no change detected, the component won't re-render, as it assumes that the output will be the same. Thus potentially improving performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

- However, it's important to note that the `PureComponent` might not be suitable for deeply nested data structures or complex objects. In such cases, using `Component` could be more efficient.

### When to use `PureComponent` over `Component`:

1. **Performance Optimization:** Use `PureComponent` when you want to optimize performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.

2. **Simple State/Props Structures:** When your component's props and state are simple data types (strings, numbers, booleans, etc.) or shallow data structures (arrays, objects), using `PureComponent` can be effective.

3. **Avoiding Manual shouldComponentUpdate:** `PureComponent` automatically performs a shallow comparison for prop and state changes. With `Component`, you might need to manually implement `shouldComponentUpdate` to achieve similar optimizations.
