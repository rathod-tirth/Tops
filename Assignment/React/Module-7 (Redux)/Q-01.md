## Q-01) What is Redux?

- Redux is a state management library primarily used with JavaScript and frameworks like React. 

- It helps manage the state of an application by providing a predictable state container. 

- Redux maintains the entire state of an application in a single immutable state tree. The state tree is changed by dispatching actions, which are plain JavaScript objects describing what should change in the state.

- Redux follows a unidirectional data flow pattern, making it easier to manage and update state in large and complex applications.
