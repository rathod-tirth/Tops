## Q-04) What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to `setState` and what is its purpose?

- The second argument that can be optionally passed to the `setState` function in React is a callback function.

- This callback function is invoked after the `setState` operation is completed and the component has been re-rendered with the updated state. 

- Its purpose is to perform actions or execute code that relies on the updated state.

### Example of using the callback function with `setState`:

```javascript
this.setState(
  { count: this.state.count + 1 },
  () => {
    // Callback function executed after state update and re-render
    console.log('State updated:', this.state.count);
    // Additional actions based on the updated state
  }
);
```

- The callback function can be useful for performing tasks that depend on the updated state, such as triggering side effects, making calculations, or executing code that should run after the state has been updated and the component has been re-rendered.
