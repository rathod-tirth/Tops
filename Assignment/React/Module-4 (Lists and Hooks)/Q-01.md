## Q) Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with Hooks

In React, component lifecycles refer to the different stages a component goes through during its existence. Traditionally, class components have used lifecycle methods to manage these stages, while functional components with hooks introduced a more declarative way to handle component lifecycles. Let's compare the two:

### Lifecycle in Class Components:

Class components have a set of lifecycle methods that you can override to execute code at various stages of a component's life. Here are some key lifecycle methods in class components:

1. **Mounting Phase:**

   - `constructor()`: This is the first method called when an instance of the component is created. You can set initial state and bind event handlers here.

   - `componentWillMount()`: Deprecated in React 16.3 and removed in React 17. It used to be called just before the component is inserted into the DOM.

   - `render()`: This method is required and returns the JSX that represents the component's UI.

   - `componentDidMount()`: Called after the component is rendered to the DOM. It's commonly used for making AJAX requests or setting up event listeners.

2. **Updating Phase:**

   - `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`: Called before rendering when new props or state are received. You can optimize performance by returning `false` to prevent unnecessary updates.

   - `componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`: Deprecated in React 16.3 and removed in React 17. Used to be called just before rendering when new props or state were received.

   - `render()`: Again, this method is required and returns the updated JSX.

   - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`: Called after the component's update is reflected in the DOM. Useful for post-update tasks.

3. **Unmounting Phase:**

   - `componentWillUnmount()`: Called just before the component is removed from the DOM. You should clean up any resources, such as event listeners or timers, here.

### Lifecycle in Functional Components with Hooks:

Functional components with hooks introduced a more declarative way to manage component lifecycles. Here are the equivalent hooks for the phases mentioned above:

1. **Mounting Phase:**

   - `useState()`: Allows you to manage state within a functional component.

   - `useEffect(() => {}, [])`: Replaces `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`. The function passed to `useEffect` runs after the component renders. The second argument (an empty array `[]`) ensures it only runs once after the initial render, similar to `componentDidMount`.

2. **Updating Phase:**

   - `useState()`: Continue to use `useState` to manage state changes.

   - `useEffect(() => {})`: The function inside `useEffect` can be used to handle side effects when props or state change. If you want to mimic the behavior of `shouldComponentUpdate`, you can use conditional logic inside the `useEffect` to skip updates.

3. **Unmounting Phase:**

   - `useEffect(() => { return () => {} }, [])`: This is used to mimic `componentWillUnmount`. You return a cleanup function inside the `useEffect` to clean up any resources when the component unmounts.

Functional components with hooks simplify component lifecycles by allowing you to manage state and side effects in a more concise and intuitive way. Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` make it easier to reason about component behavior and can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.
