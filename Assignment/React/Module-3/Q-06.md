## Q-06) What is Header and Content Components in React Js?

In React.js, the concepts of "Header" and "Content" components are used to describe a common pattern for organizing the structure of a React application, often in the context of building a user interface or a layout for a web application.

1. **Header Component:** The Header component usually represents the top part of a web page or a section within a page. It typically contains elements like the website logo, navigation menus, user authentication controls, or any other content.

Example of a Header component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>My Website</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>About</li>
          <li>Contact</li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
  );
}

export default Header;
```

2. **Content Component:** The "Content" component is responsible for rendering the main content of a web page or view. This is where you display the primary information or features of your application.

Example of a Content component in React:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Content() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h2>Welcome to our website!</h2>
      <p>This is the main content area where you can display your content dynamically.</p>
    </main>
  );
}

export default Content;
```
