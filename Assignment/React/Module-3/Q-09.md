## Q-09) How to change in components of React Js?

1. **Updating state value in useState:**

   The `useState` hook is a fundamental hook in React that allows functional components to manage and update state. 
   
   If the state value changes the component re-renders and changes as well.

   ```jsx
   import React, { useState } from 'react';

   function MyComponent() {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     const incrementCount = () => {
       setCount(count + 1);
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <p>Count: {count}</p>
         <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Providing different data in Props:**

   "Props" is short for "properties," and it refers to a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component.

   By Providing different data in parent element the component can be changed.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function MyComponent(props) {
     return (
       <div>
         <h2>{props.title}</h2>
         <p>{props.article}</p>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
