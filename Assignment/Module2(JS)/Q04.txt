    JavaScript, often referred to as JS, was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation in the mid-1990s. 
Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape, created JavaScript in just 10 days in September 1995. The initial 
version of JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to web pages and was originally named "LiveScript." 
However, due to the popularity of Java at the time, Netscape decided to rename it to JavaScript to capitalize 
on the Java brand.
