        In JavaScript, `void(0)` is an expression that evaluates to `undefined`. The `void` operator is used to evaluate an
    expression and return `undefined` as the result. It is typically used as a way to prevent the browser from
    navigating to a new page when a hyperlink is clicked. By setting the `href` attribute of an anchor tag to
    `javascript:void(0)`, clicking the link will not cause any navigation action to occur.
