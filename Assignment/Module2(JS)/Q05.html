    1. Undeclared variables: An undeclared variable is a variable that has been used in the code without being declared or
    defined using the "var", "let", or "const" keywords. When you attempt to use an undeclared variable, JavaScript will
    throw a ReferenceError. It means that the variable has not been declared anywhere in the code.<br><br>

    2. Undefined variables: An undefined variable is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
    When you access an undefined variable, its value is "undefined." JavaScript assigns the "undefined" value to
    variables by default if no explicit value has been assigned.
