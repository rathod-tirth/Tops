    In JavaScript, negative infinity is a special value that represents a number that is smaller than any other number,
    including negative numbers. It is denoted by the keyword "Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY". Negative infinity is often used
    to represent values that are not defined or unreachable within the numeric range. Negative infinity is part of
    JavaScript's number data type and can be compared, added, subtracted, or used in mathematical operations like any
    other number.
