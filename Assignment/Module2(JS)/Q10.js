/*  On the client side, you canâ€™t read or write files in JavaScript browsers. The fs module in Node.js may 
be used to accomplish this on the server-side. It has methods for reading and writing files on the file 
system that are both synchronous and asynchronous. 

    The fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using javascript. 
The file is read using the fs.readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method. This technique reads the 
full file into memory and stores it in a buffer. */
