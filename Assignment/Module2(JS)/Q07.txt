=> ViewState is used to store the state of an individual web page and its controls, typically within a hidden field on the
page. It is used to maintain the values of controls across postbacks, allowing the page to remember user input and
maintain its state.

=> SessionState is used to store user-specific data across multiple requests and pages within a web
application. It is stored on the server and associated with a specific user session. SessionState allows developers to
maintain user-specific information, such as login credentials or shopping cart items, throughout their interaction with
the application.
