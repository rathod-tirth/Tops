## (Q-10) What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?

- A trigger in SQL is a database object that automatically executes a set of SQL statements when a specific event occurs.

- These events are typically related to data changes in a table, such as insertions, updates, or deletions.

- To create a trigger in SQL, you use the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement, which allows you to define the trigger's name, the event that activates it (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), the table it applies to, the timing (BEFORE or AFTER the event), and the actions to be executed when the trigger fires.

### Basic syntax for creating a trigger in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
[BEFORE | AFTER] [INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE] ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Trigger actions (SQL statements)
END;
```
