## 3) What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

DBMS (Database Management System) and RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) are both software systems designed to manage databases, but they have some key differences in terms of data storage, data organization, and how they handle data.

| DBMS                                      | RDBMS                                      |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Handles various data formats              | Strictly manages structured data in tables  |
| Various storage methods, less structured | Enforces structured, tabular data storage   |
| No specific model enforced                | Strict adherence to the relational model  |
| Varies based on the DBMS in use          | Typically uses SQL for querying            |
| May have fewer constraints               | Enforces constraints and referential integrity |
| Not necessarily ACID compliant            | Often adheres to ACID properties for data integrity |
| Offers flexibility but may have limitations | Can face challenges with large and high-velocity data |
