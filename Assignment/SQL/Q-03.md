## 3) What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

DBMS (Database Management System) and RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) are both software systems designed to manage databases, but they have some key differences in terms of data storage, data organization, and how they handle data.

| Aspect                                      | DBMS                                      | RDBMS                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Data Structure                             | Handles various data formats              | Strictly manages structured data in tables  |
| Data Storage                               | Various storage methods, less structured | Enforces structured, tabular data storage   |
| Data Model                                 | No specific model enforced                | Strict adherence to the relational model  |
| Query Language                             | Varies based on the DBMS in use          | Typically uses SQL for querying            |
| Data Integrity and Constraints              | May have fewer constraints               | Enforces constraints and referential integrity |
| ACID Properties                            | Not necessarily ACID compliant            | Often adheres to ACID properties for data integrity |
| Scalability                                | Offers flexibility but may have limitations | Can face challenges with large and high-velocity data |
