## 9) What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query?

- A savepoint in a relational database is a point within a transaction where you can set a named marker or checkpoint, allowing you to later roll back to that specific point in the transaction if needed. 

General syntax:

```sql
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

Example of how to create a savepoint in a SQL transaction:

```sql
BEGIN; -- Start a transaction

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName) VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe');
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName) VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith');

-- Create a savepoint
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

-- More data modifications
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName) VALUES (3, 'Robert', 'Johnson');

-- If something goes wrong, you can roll back to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;

-- Additional data modifications
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName) VALUES (4, 'Mary', 'Wilson');

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```
