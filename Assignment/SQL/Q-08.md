## (Q-8) What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints.

- SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.

- Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.

### Example :

1. **PRIMARY KEY :**
   - The primary key should be not null and unique in the table.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Students (
       StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY
   );
   ```

2. **UNIQUE :**
   - It should be unique in the entire column.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employees (
       EmployeeID INT UNIQUE
   );
   ```

3. **FOREIGN KEY :**
   - The FOREIGN KEY constraint establishes a relationship between two tables.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       CustomerID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
   );
   ```
