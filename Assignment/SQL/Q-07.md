## 7) What is DML Compiler in SQL?

In SQL (Structured Query Language), a DML (Data Manipulation Language) compiler is a component of a database management system (DBMS) that is responsible for processing and optimizing data manipulation operations. 

- DML statements are used to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from a database. 

The DML compiler performs tasks such as query optimization, where it evaluates different execution strategies to select the most efficient one, and it also handles the interpretation of complex queries, joining data from multiple tables, and applying filtering conditions. 

- Additionally, the DML compiler works in coordination with the DDL (Data Definition Language) interpreter, which deals with defining and managing the database's structure. Together, these components allow users and applications to interact with the database, retrieve information, and make changes to the data while ensuring data consistency and efficiency in the DBMS.
