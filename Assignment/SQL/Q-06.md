## 6) What is DDL Interpreter?

-  DDL statements are used to define, modify, and manage the structure of a database, including creating tables, defining indexes, specifying constraints, and altering the schema.

- The DDL interpreter translates these high-level statements into low-level instructions that the DBMS uses to make changes to the database schema.

- Some common DDL statements include:

1. **CREATE TABLE:** Used to create a new table with a specified structure, including column names, data types, and constraints.

2. **ALTER TABLE:** Used to modify an existing table, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns or constraints.

3. **DROP TABLE:** Used to delete a table and its associated data from the database.

4. **CREATE INDEX:** Used to create an index on one or more columns of a table to optimize query performance.

5. **CREATE VIEW:** Used to create a virtual table that provides a customized view of the data in one or more base tables.
