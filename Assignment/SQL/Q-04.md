## (Q-4) What is Codd's Rule of RDBMS Systems?

Codd's Rules, also known as Codd's Twelve Rules, were formulated by Dr. Edgar F. Codd, a computer scientist who is widely recognized for his pioneering work in the field of relational databases.

1. **Information Rule:** All data in the database must be stored in tables (relations) and every data value must be accessible by specifying a table name, a primary key value, and a column name.

2. **Guaranteed Access Rule:** Each data value in a relational database must be accessible by specifying a precise and unambiguous address, typically table name, primary key, and column name.

3. **Systematic Treatment of Null Values:** The DBMS must allow each field to remain null (or empty). Null values are used to represent missing or unknown information.

4. **Dynamic Online Catalog Based on the Relational Model:** The database's structure, including the schema and constraints, must be stored in a catalog that the DBMS itself manages.

5. **Comprehensive Data Sublanguage Rule:** The DBMS must provide a comprehensive language for defining, querying, and manipulating data in the database. SQL is an example of such a language.

6. **View Updating Rule:** All views that are theoretically updatable must be updatable by the DBMS, which means that modifications made to the view should be reflected in the base tables.

7. **High-Level Insert, Update, and Delete:** The DBMS must support high-level operations for inserting, updating, and deleting data, rather than requiring the user to write low-level code to perform these tasks.

8. **Physical Data Independence:** Changes to the physical storage structures should not require changes to the application programs or queries. This provides a level of abstraction between the logical and physical aspects of the database.

9. **Logical Data Independence:** Changes to the logical structure, such as adding or modifying tables or columns, should not require changes to application programs or queries. This ensures that the data model can evolve independently of the application.

10. **Integrity Independence:** Integrity constraints, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and other data validation rules, should be separate from the application programs and should be enforced by the DBMS.

11. **Distribution Independence:** The DBMS should provide mechanisms for distributing and accessing data across a network without changing the application.

12. **The Nonsubversion Rule:** If a relational system has low-level (record-at-a-time) access, it must also have high-level (set-at-a-time) access. This rule aims to prevent users from bypassing the high-level, integrity-preserving operations provided by the DBMS.
