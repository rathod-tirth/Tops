>> Bootstrap Grid System:

>> The Bootstrap grid system is a fundamental part of the framework that allows developers to create responsive and 
adaptive layouts effortlessly. It is based on a 12-column grid system, where the page layout is divided into 
horizontal columns. 

>> These columns can be combined and arranged to create different responsive layouts for various screen sizes. By 
using pre-defined CSS classes, developers can easily specify the width and positioning of elements within the grid, 
making it simple to achieve a desired layout. 

>> With the grid system's responsiveness, web pages built with Bootstrap automatically adjust and reflow their content 
to fit different devices, ensuring optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The grid 
system's flexibility and ease of use make it a popular choice for building responsive websites efficiently.
