Differences between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5:

1. Smaller File Size: Bootstrap 5 has a smaller file size compared to Bootstrap 4. It achieved this by removing jQuery as a dependency and 
rewriting the JavaScript components in vanilla JavaScript. This change reduces the overall footprint of Bootstrap and improves performance.

2. New Utility Classes: Bootstrap 5 introduced a range of new utility classes, including spacing utilities (`m-*` and `p-*` classes) that 
provide more granular control over margins and padding. Additionally, new utility classes like `gap-*` were added to control the spacing between 
grid columns and rows.

3. Updated Default Colors: Bootstrap 5 introduced a new and updated color palette with a fresh set of default colors. It offers a more modern 
and refined look compared to the colors used in Bootstrap 4.

4. Improved Grid System: While both versions use a 12-column grid system, Bootstrap 5 enhanced the grid system by introducing new classes like 
`col-*`, `col-*-auto`, and `col-*-order-*`. These classes provide more flexibility in controlling the column widths, auto-sizing behavior, and 
ordering of columns.

5. Replaced Glyphicons: Bootstrap 5 removed Glyphicons, the icon font used in Bootstrap 4, and replaced it with the new `Bootstrap Icons` 
library. This change provides a more extensive collection of icons designed specifically for Bootstrap.

6. New Components: Bootstrap 5 introduced several new components, such as `Switches`, `Floating Labels`, and `Offcanvas` navigation. These new 
components offer additional functionality and options for building modern web interfaces.

7. Improved Documentation: The documentation for Bootstrap 5 has been revamped and expanded, providing more comprehensive and detailed guidance 
for developers. It offers clearer explanations, updated examples, and improved searchability, making it easier to work with the framework.
