            Bootstrap cards are a versatile and flexible component used to display content in a visually appealing
            and organized manner. Here's an explanation of Bootstrap cards in a few points: <br><br>

            1. Content Container: Bootstrap cards serve as a container for displaying various types of content, such as
            text, images, buttons, or other HTML elements. They provide a structured and visually appealing way to
            present information. <br><br>

            2. Card Styles: Bootstrap cards come with default styling options that can be easily customized. You can
            choose from different card styles, including basic cards, image cards, header and footer cards, card decks,
            and card columns, to suit your design needs.<br><br>

            3. Responsive Layout: Cards in Bootstrap are responsive by default, meaning they automatically adjust their
            size and layout to fit different screen sizes and devices. This makes them suitable for building
            mobile-friendly and responsive web pages.<br><br>

            4. Card Components: Bootstrap cards can include various components, such as card headers, card bodies, card
            footers, and optional card overlays. These components allow you to structure and organize your content
            effectively.<br><br>

            5. Card Features: Bootstrap cards offer additional features like card titles, subtitles, text content,
            images, buttons, and card links. These features help enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the
            cards.<br><br>

            By utilizing Bootstrap cards, you can create visually appealing and well-structured content containers on
            your website or application. They offer flexibility, responsiveness, and a range of customization options,
            making them a popular choice for displaying various types of content in a clean and organized manner. <br><br>
