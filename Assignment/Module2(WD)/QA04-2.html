    <h1>Wood</h1>
    <p class="one">Wood is a structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees and other woody plants. It is an
        organic material - a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix
        of lignin that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees,
        or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or
        shrubs.[citation needed] In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or
        to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and
        the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered
        from wood, or woodchips or fiber.</p>

    <p class="two">Wood has been used for thousands of years for fuel, as a construction material, for making tools and
        weapons, furniture and paper. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose
        and its derivatives, such as cellophane and cellulose acetate.</p>

    <p class="three">As of 2020, the growing stock of forests worldwide was about 557 billion cubic meters. As an
        abundant, carbon-neutral renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of
        renewable energy. In 2008, approximately 3.97 billion cubic meters of wood were harvested. Dominant uses were
        for furniture and building construction.</p>
