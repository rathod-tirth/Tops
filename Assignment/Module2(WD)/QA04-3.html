    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: white; font-family: verdana; text-decoration: underline 4px royalblue;">Air</h1>

    <p style="color: lightseagreen;">Air is the Earth's atmosphere. Air is a mixture of many gases and tiny dust particles.
        It is the clear gas in which living things live and breathe. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has mass
        and weight, because it is matter. The weight of air creates atmospheric pressure. There is no air in outer
        space.</p>

    <p style="color: hotpink;">Atmosphere is a mixture of about 78% nitrogen, 21% of oxygen, and 1% other gases,
        such as Carbon Dioxide.<br>

        Animals live and need to breathe the oxygen in the atmosphere. In breathing, the lungs put oxygen into the
        blood, and send back carbon dioxide to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off
        the oxygen that we breathe. Without it we die of asphyxia. <br>

        Air can be polluted by some gases (such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides), smoke, and ash.
        This air pollution causes various problems including smog, acid rain and global warming. It can damage people's
        health and the environment. There are debates about whether or not to act upon climate change, but soon enough
        the Earth will heat up to much, causing our home to become too hot and not support life! Some say less people
        would die of cold weather, and that is true but there is already a huge amount of people dying from heat and
        that number is and will keep increasing at a frighting height.</p>

    <p style="color: cornflowerblue;">Since early times, air has been used to create technology. Ships moved with sails and
        windmills used the mechanical motion of air. Aircraft use propellers to move air over a wing, which allows them
        to fly. Pneumatics use air pressure to move things. Since the late 1900s, air power is also used to generate
        electricity. <br>

        Air is invisible: it cannot be seen by the eye, though a shimmering in hot air can be seen. <br>

        Air is one of the four classical elements.</p>
