## Q-14 What are negative indexes and why are they used?

- Negative indexes in Python are used to access elements from the end of a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) rather than from the beginning. 

- They provide a convenient way to access elements relative to the end of the sequence without needing to know its length explicitly.

### For example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 5 (last element)
print(my_list[-2])  # Output: 4 (second-to-last element)
```
