## Q-05 What is the purpose of continue statement in python?

- The `continue` statement in Python is used within loops (like `for` or `while`) to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one immediately. 

- When encountered, it jumps to the next iteration without executing the remaining code within the loop for the current iteration. This statement is helpful when you want to skip specific conditions or parts of the loop's logic without exiting the loop entirely.
