## Q-04 How memory is managed in Python?

- In Python, memory management is primarily handled by a private heap space. The Python memory manager handles the allocation of memory for Python objects. 

- It utilizes a combination of mechanisms, including reference counting for automatic garbage collection and a cyclic garbage collector for detecting and clearing unused cyclic references. 

- Python also employs memory optimization techniques like object reuse and memory pooling to efficiently manage memory allocation and deallocation, making it convenient for developers to work without explicitly managing memory.
