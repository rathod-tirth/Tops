## Q-26 Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?

### Inheritance

- Inheritance in python refers to subclass or derived class to inherit properties of superclass or base class.

```python
class School:
   def __init__(self,name,no):
      self.name=name
      self.no=no

class Student(School):
   def marksheet(self,marks):
      self.marks=marks
      return f"Name : {self.name} | Roll no : {self.no} | Marks : {self.marks}"

student=Student("Tirth",5)
print(student.marksheet(98))
```

### Constructor :

- In python `init` is a dunder method, they are called automatically on certain events related to class.

- The `init` method gets called automatically when the object is created and it is also knows as Constructor.
