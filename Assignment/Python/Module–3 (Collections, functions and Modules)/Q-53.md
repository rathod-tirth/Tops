## Q-53 How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?

1. **Built-in Functions:** These are functions that are available in Python by default, such as `print()`, `len()`, `max()`, `min()`, etc. They are part of Python's standard library.

2. **User-defined Functions:** These are functions created by users as per their requirements using the `def` keyword. Users can define functions to perform specific tasks and reuse them throughout their code.

3. **Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions):** These are small, unnamed functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. Lambda functions are typically used when a small function is required for a short period of time and don't need a separate name or def statement.
