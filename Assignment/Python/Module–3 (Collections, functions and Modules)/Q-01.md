## Q-01 What is List? How will you reverse a list?

- A list is a fundamental data structure in programming used to store a collection of items in a specific order. In Python, a list is represented by square brackets `[]` and can contain elements of different data types. 

- To reverse a list in Python, you can use the `reverse()` method or slicing. Here are examples of both methods:

1. #### Using the `reverse()` method:
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   my_list.reverse()
   print(my_list)  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
   ```

2. #### Using slicing:
   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   reversed_list = my_list[::-1]
   print(reversed_list)  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
   ```
