## Q-19 What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

- A tuple is a data structure in Python used to store collection of elements.

### Differences between a list and a tuple:

- Lists are mutable, whereas Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed or modified.

- Lists are created using square brackets `[ ]`, while tuples are created using parentheses `( )`.
