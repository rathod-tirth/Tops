## Q-44 Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?

- The `zip()` function in Python is used to combine or "zip" multiple iterables together.

#### 1. Creating Dictionaries:

- You can use `zip()` with dictionary comprehension to create dictionaries from two lists.

```python
li1=[5,10,36,78]
li2=[61,25,14,87]

di=dict(zip(li1,li2))

print(di) # output: {5: 61, 10: 25, 36: 14, 78: 87}
```

#### 3. Unzipping Sequences:

- You can also use `zip()` to unzip a sequence of tuples back into separate lists.

```python
zip1={5: 61, 10: 25, 36: 14, 78: 87}

a,b=zip(*zip1)

print(a,b) # output: (5, 10, 36, 78) (61, 25, 14, 87)
```
