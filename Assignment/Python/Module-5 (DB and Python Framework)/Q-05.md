## Q-05 What is a QuerySet? Write program to create a new Post object in database:

- A `QuerySet` is a collection of database queries used to retrieve data from the database.

- `QuerySet` allows you to filter, order, and manipulate data before retrieving it from the database.

```python
from .models import Post

post=Post.objects.create(title='Post Title', content='This is post content')
post.save()
```
